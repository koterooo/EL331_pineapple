# KWIC Web App

**This repository contains a KWIC (Key Word In Context) Web Application built with Flask and spaCy.**  
This tool allows you to search and analyze text corpora for keywords, lemmas, part-of-speech tags, and named entities, and displays the context of each match in a KWIC table.

---

## Features

- Upload a `.txt` corpus (UTF-8 or Shift_JIS encoding supported)
- Search by:
  - Exact token (word/phrase)
  - Lemma (base form)
  - Part-of-speech (POS) tag
  - Named Entity (NER label)
- Adjustable context window size for KWIC
- Sort results by:
  - Document order (sequential)
  - Most frequent next token
  - Most frequent next POS
- Displays most frequent patterns after the keyword
- Loading indicator for large corpora

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- spaCy (`en_core_web_sm` model)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

## Usage

1. **Upload a text corpus** (plain `.txt`) or paste text into the text area.
2. **Select search type** (Token, Lemma, POS, Entity) and input the target word/tag/entity.
3. **Adjust context window size** if needed (number of words shown before/after keyword).
4. **Choose sorting method** (document order, next-token frequency, next-POS frequency).
5. **Click "Run KWIC Search".**
6. Results and frequent next-token patterns will be displayed in tables below the form.
